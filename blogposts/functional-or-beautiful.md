## Design is not art

You may have seen these beautiful websites with 3D moving graphics and animations happening all over the screen, they might have even won design awards or have trended on social media. Those sites are art, and in my opinion design is not art, design solves a problem, it has a practical purpose. 

## The purpose of good design

If you want to win art awards or impress your art teacher, you make a beautiful website. If you want to generate traffic, get subscriptions or get sales, you create a website with good design. Take a look at the best websites in the world, they all have design that serves a purpose. A course website have to get subscribers, a blog site needs readers that stay for a long time, and e-commerce websites have loads of products that needs selling.

## Real world examples

Do you find websites like amazon, google, youtube, facebook or instagram beautiful? If you look at the most visited websites in the world on semrush, you will not find a single beautiful website. These giant companies have enough money to hire the best of the best web designers in the world, but yet their websites are so simple and "boring". This is because the developers they hire cost a lot of money, and that means the websites top priority needs to be to generate profit, and beautiful websites are not optimized for that.

Website designers do not make beautiful websites, because their work and career revolves around metrics and not the looks of the website.

## Why can't we create a website that is both beautiful and functional?

Why do you as a user visit a website? Maybe to watch videos, learn something, browse social media or check your bank account?
Whatever you do, you certanly do not want to visit a website that is advanced or wastes your time. You want easy access to all the buttons and a straight forward experience.
